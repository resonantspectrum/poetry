If I expected love when first we kissed
Blame it on my youth
If only just for you I did exist
Blame it on my youth
I believed in everything
Like a child at three
You meant more than everything
All the world to me
If you were on my mind all night and day
Blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray
Blame it on my youth
If I cried a little bit
When first I learned the truth
Don't blame it on my heart
Blame it on my-y youth
If you were on my mind all night and day-ay
Blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray
Blame it on my youth
If I cried a little bit
When first I learned the truth
Don't blame it on my heart
Blame it on my youth

Blame It On My Youth lyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Group

In honor of my 65th birthday, I have written a parody to a song so
old, probably nobody younger than me even knows the original.

If crude displays of power and wealth
Draw from me gasps of rage

If I should identify with hopeless misfits and praise rebel mavericks

sage

guage

wage

stage

If I should check the source a quotation
And quote the verse and page

Blame it on my age

A life based more on goals than gold

Don't blame it on a phage--
Blame it on my age.
