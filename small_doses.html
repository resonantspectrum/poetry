Small doses

Best call hero those who carried you across the mountains,
Those who forded raging rivers attached to you by rope.

Heroship, as a distinction, should be subject to distinction--

Although distinguished, it does not bend readily to distinguishing its qualities.

Reverend Doctor was an appelation for a plagiarist,
but who created a third American revolution in a sweltering room
with all those who took their places on the floor.

And while we don't have [honor] for what the heroes are known,
We can return them from dishonor.

Carmichael was not prone to dismiss the heroines who ferried his movement to freedom.

It is useless to speculate whether Luxemburg could have been a heroine
had she escaped being a martyr.

If you assign hero status append a date, such as
Churchill 1940-1944 or Malcolm 1964-1965.

Heroize each act.
You need not honor Leo for acting the kulak, swinging his own scythe with his servants,
but can honor suffering Sophia for editing seven drafts of War and Peace.

Take your heroes in small doses,
[Lovingly cleansed] through filters,
So you can sip the fiery infusion for moments yourself.
