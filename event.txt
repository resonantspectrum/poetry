When offering praise for my editing,
An author called the release of his book a major turning point in his career.
After offering my congratulations,
I hung up and began editing the book of my newest author.

The surgery that saves your life is to you a major event,
But everyone else in the hospital must transport the gauze, wash the floor, and code the insurance forms
While the surgeon checks the score between the Angels and the Royals.

A picture floats by of a person standing by the clutter of wood
That used to be a house.
Sure, we can give twenty dollars with a click--
But we save cash for the next disaster.

Still, all of us will probably mark the day
When the firmament is ablaze.
