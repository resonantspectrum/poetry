Would I point the hands of history counterclockwise and reverse events?

I know that nothing remains to be done.
Heads turned as I flubbed my reply to the intemperate outburst that overturned comport,
And every [penetrating] eye who turned my way remains in my memory.
No statute of limitations applies to poorly chosen retorts.

Some roads end in an outburst of vegetation,
Others in blank warehouses.

---

Like the nauseated silence that follows an irretrievably uncouth remark

Only if I could return to that joust,
And place my rook squarely in the path of the maurading queen,
I would [challenge, hail] the clock of history,
Offering, in parody to its cruely advancing hands, my own limbs to crank back time.
[And with elegant gestures mold a dialog with the world.]

I would pursue the imp of my downfall to the edge of the cosmos
