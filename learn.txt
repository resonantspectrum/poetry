So many things

There were so many things I wanted to learn--
Where the road that left my town came to an end.
What people were saying to each other in their own guttural language,
And how they felt living day after day away from home.

Spiritual advisors advised us to look within,
Saying all truth could be found in our own hearts.

But I knew that was false.
